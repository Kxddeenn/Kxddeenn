# Hi there! 👋

I'm  Kaden Neild, a second year Computer Engineer @ Queen's University with a passion for web development and AI technologies.
I have currently 1 year of experience in JavaScript and Node.js. 
Learning C/C++ in school and Python individually and in my work-coop.
I also have many interests in learning Vue.js and Electron in the future.  

## 🔭 Current Projects
- **Automation of Excel Certificates with UI**:
  A task given to automatically read CSV Files and XML files and convert them into appriopriate data for excel handling.
This project's UI was built using customtkinter whilst data handling was openpyxl, pandas and csv in Python Libraries.
The project also consisted of uploading files and data to sharepoint automatically for storage and usage. 

- **Power Apps and Power Automate**:
    Throughout my Co-op term, I spent a lot on making Power Apps to improve readbility and organization within the company.
  This involved uploading data to Sharepoint lists and further extracting it to specific folders throughout the company's database.
  This improved my overall development in **Power Px**, a new programming language exclusively for Microsoft Applications. 

## 🌱 Learning and Growing
- Currently exploring Vue.js, improving my Javascript and Node.js skillset. 
- Improving my code readability and documentation.
